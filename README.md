## Description

Create a library of at least 20 commonly used Lodash methods with documentation and commenting using ES2015. Publish the code as a package to NPM.

## Context

This goal is important for:
- learning JavaScript
- understanding how developer write higher-level code for others to use
- understanding ES2015

This code will be used by other developers to make their jobs easier.

The questions that this project will raise are:
- how do we write packages that are easy to understand and simple to use out of the box?
- how to publish a package to NPM?

## Specifications

### Required

- [X] Includes a list of commonly used methods to rewrite in ES2015 (minimum 20).
- [X] Includes a README that describes each method and provides an example of use.
- [X] Package is published with NPM.
- [X] Includes tests for all methods described.
- [X] The artifact produced is properly licensed, preferably with the [MIT license][mit-license].

### Quality

- [X] Each individual function is self-documenting using intuitive names with a matching file name. (e.g., function map corresponds to map.js)
- [X] Each function is imported into a single file.
- [X] The main file is organized imperatively via script (see _c.js).
- [X] The documentation is organized imperatively via script (see joinDocs.js and docs.md).
- [X] Branch names and commit messages are descriptive.
